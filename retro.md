# Using retrospectives in software development teams

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

The team draws a wheel and adds different elements in their work to the field to certain categories that are the following: 
Start, Stop, Continue, More of and Less of. The goal of this exercise is to gain some insight into what the actual team members want
to see more of in the next sprint or overall in the workplace (or less of, etc). 

## Glad, Sad, Mad

The glad, sad, mad retrospective style is used to openly discuss areas of the development with the development team
and how different past events in the previous sprint have influenced the mood of the team. The goal of the retrospective
method is to improve the quality of the team members work by getting some feedback on the areas in the work that the team
likes and on the other hand, doesn't like or would like to see improved.
